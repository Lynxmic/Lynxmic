### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I created this GitHub account back in 2017 so that I can have a place where I can open-source my work that involve some code along the way. My code so far have involved Discord bots and static websites (in other words, I didn't really do anything significant enough when it comes to development).

Currently, 99.99999% of my time spent coding is on the [Lynxmic Blog](https://lynxmic.github.io) ([view source](https://github.com/Lynxmic/lynxmic.github.io)), which has been powered by Jekyll since 2021. Otherwise, I'm focused most of the time on other stuff, such as content creation (you can find the link to my YT channel below).
