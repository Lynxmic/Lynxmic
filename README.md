### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I created this GitHub account back in 2017 so that I can have a place where I can open-source my work that involve some code along the way. My code so far have involved Discord bots and static websites (in other words, I didn't really do anything significant enough when it comes to development).

Currently, 99.99999% of my time spent coding is on the [lynxmic.github.io website](https://lynxmic.github.io) and the blog. Otherwise, most of my time spent on the productive side of things is focused on other hobbies such as content creation ([I run a 300+ subscriber tech channel](https://youtube.com/@Lynxmic)).
