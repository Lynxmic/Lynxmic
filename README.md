### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I created this GitHub account back in 2017 so that I can have a place where I can open-source my work that involve some code along the way. My code so far have involved Discord bots and static websites (in other words, I didn't really do anything significant enough when it comes to development).

Currently, 99.99999% of my time spent coding is on the [Lynxmic Blog](https://lynxmic.github.io), which has been powered by Jekyll since 2021. Otherwise, I'm focused most of the time on other stuff, such as content creation, mostly for my [YouTube channel](https://youtube.com/@Lynxmic).
