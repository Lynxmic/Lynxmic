### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I've been coding stuff mostly between 2017-2019, projects from that period included mostly static websites and Discord bots. I am currently not into the hobby actively with the exception of [my Jekyll blog](https://lynxmic.github.io), but I still run some non-code-related projects, including:

* **The Lynxmic YT channel**: I've been making videos for this channel since late 2016; this is where Lynxmic history began. Usually, a new video would come out every Saturday at 11:00 GMT+2; sometimes, but rarely, there may be a extra video during the weekdays. The channel is ran together with two other channels: *Lynxmic Gold* for extra content and behind-the-scenes and *Lynxmic Archives* for older videos never published even once (or videos from other channels I since deleted).

* **Lynxmic's Square**: A 35+ member Discord server I've been operating since late 2017. Formerly Axeon & Aqua Community, it's currently inactive most of the time but I won't mind if you take some effort to revive it. [Link](https://discord.io/lynxmic)
