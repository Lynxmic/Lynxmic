### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I've been coding stuff mostly between 2017-2019, projects from that period included websites and Discord bots. I am currently no longer into the hobby actively (with the exception of the Jekyll-powered Lynxmic Blog ([link](https://lynxmic.github.io)) which required some coding to fit best with my branding), but I still run some non-code-related projects, including:

* **The Lynxmic YT channel**: I've been making videos for this channel since late 2016; this is where Lynxmic history began. Usually, a new video would come out every Saturday at 11:00 GMT+2; sometimes, but rarely, there may be a extra video during the weekdays. The channel is ran together with two other channels: *Lynxmic Gold* for extra content and behind-the-scenes and *Lynxmic Archives* for older videos never published even once (or videos from other channels I since deleted).

* **Axeon**: A 60+ member Discord server I've been operating since late 2017, but it currently it isn't in my priorities (though I have plans for it in the future). The reason I'm saying this is bc the server is currently 99% dead (activity-wise) but I'm still going to mention it here as long as it is still a thing. [Link](https://discord.io/lynxmic)
